# SRXDCustomVisuals
SRXDCustomVisuals is a set of mods that enable custom visual elements to be imported into charts

### Importing New Backgrounds

- If you have not run SRXD with the mod yet, do that first so the mod can generate any necessary directories
- Add any asset bundle and manifest files (such as common and common.manifest from SRXDVisualsProjectTemplate) to the AssetBundles folder in your plugins folder
- Add the background definition .json file to the Backgrounds folder in your plugins folder
- Add any additional assemblies (such as SRXDBackgrounds.Common.dll) used by the background to your plugins folder
