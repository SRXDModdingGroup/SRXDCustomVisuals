# SRXDCustomVisuals
SRXDCustomVisuals is a set of mods that enable custom visual elements to be imported into charts

### Importing New Backgrounds

- If you have not run SRXD with the mod yet, do that first so the mod can generate any necessary directories
- Download the .zip file from the background's newest release and extract it directly to your BepInEx plugins folder
